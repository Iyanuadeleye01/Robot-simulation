# Robot-simulation
This project aims to carry out the Simulation of autonomous ICU-cleaning robots in a 5x5 grid. It compares Random Movement vs Optimized Coverage strategies, with performance metrics (time, coverage, collisions), path visualizations, and animations. It demonstrates Python simulation modelling, algorithm optimization, and robotics pathfinding.
